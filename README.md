# ðŸ§  Resume Knowledge Base Builder with Vector Search & Reranking

Resume Search and Retrieval System
This project implements a resume search and retrieval system using vector embeddings and reranking to efficiently match candidates to job criteria. It processes PDF resumes, converts them into a vector database, and retrieves relevant resumes using semantic search and reranking.

Overview
The system loads PDF resumes from a directory, optionally merges metadata from a CSV file, and processes them into a FAISS vector database using text splitting and embeddings from the thenlper/gte-small model. It supports complex queries to retrieve resumes based on job roles, skills, experience, and locations, with reranking to ensure high relevance.
Features

PDF Resume Loading: Extracts text from PDF resumes using PyPDFLoader.
Metadata Integration: Merges metadata from a CSV file (e.g., candidate ID, category).
Text Splitting: Chunks resume content using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient processing.
Vector Database: Builds a FAISS vector store with embeddings for semantic search.
Semantic Search: Retrieves resumes using cosine similarity.
Reranking: Applies FlashrankRerank to refine results to the top 5 most relevant resumes.
Flexible Queries: Supports complex queries with AND, OR, NOT operators, and filters for experience and location.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Install dependencies:
pip install -q torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes langchain sentence-transformers faiss-cpu openpyxl datasets pypdf langchain-community langchain-huggingface ragatouille
pip install flashrank


Prepare your data:

Place PDF resumes in a directory (e.g., /path/to/resumes/data).
Optionally, provide a CSV file with metadata (e.g., /path/to/resumes/Resume.csv) including columns like ID.



Usage

Load and process resumes:
DATA_DIR = "/path/to/resumes/data"
CSV_PATH = "/path/to/resumes/Resume.csv"
docs = load_resumes(DATA_DIR, CSV_PATH)


Query the system:
query = """
"Machine Learning Engineer" OR "Data Scientist" AND (
  ("Python" AND ("Scikit-learn" OR "TensorFlow" OR "PyTorch"))
  ("SQL" AND ("Spark" OR "Hadoop" OR "ETL"))
  ("AWS" OR "GCP" OR "Azure" OR "MLOps")
  ("Tableau" OR "Power BI" OR "data visualization")
  ("statistical analysis" OR "A/B testing")
  ("NLP" OR "LLM" OR "GenAI" OR "recommendation systems")
)
NOT ("intern" OR "student")
Years: "3+ years"
Location: "Remote" OR "Mumbai" OR "Bangalore" OR "Pune"
"""
compressed_docs = compression_retriever.invoke(query)
print([doc.metadata.get("id") for doc in compressed_docs])



Code Structure

Resume Loading: load_resumes function extracts text from PDFs and merges CSV metadata.
Text Splitting: Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with Markdown separators to chunk text.
Embedding Generation: Creates embeddings with thenlper/gte-small via HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
Vector Database: Stores embeddings in a FAISS vector store with cosine similarity.
Retrieval and Reranking: Retrieves top 30 resumes, then reranks to top 5 using FlashrankRerank.

How It Works

Resume Loading: Reads PDFs and merges metadata (if provided) based on resume IDs.
Text Processing: Converts resumes to LangchainDocument objects and splits into chunks (1000 characters, 100 overlap).
Embedding and Vector Store: Tokenizes chunks and generates embeddings, storing them in FAISS.
Retrieval and Reranking: Performs semantic search to retrieve top 30 resumes, then reranks to top 5.

Example Query
The example query searches for:

Roles: Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist.
Skills: Python (with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch), SQL (with Spark, Hadoop, or ETL), cloud platforms, data visualization, statistical analysis or A/B testing, NLP/LLM/GenAI or recommendation systems.
Exclusions: No interns or students.
Experience: 3+ years.
Location: Remote, Mumbai, Bangalore, or Pune.

Output
A list of the top 5 resume IDs:
['resume_id_1', 'resume_id_2', 'resume_id_3', 'resume_id_4', 'resume_id_5']
